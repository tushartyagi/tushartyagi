				<title>Concept of death</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["I've been thinking death lately", said a character of a <a title="Synecdoche, New York" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383028/" target="_blank">film</a> I saw a few days back. And I've been thinking about it these days too. I guess if I die today in my sleep, it wouldn't matter. It's not like that I want to die, but suddenly the thought that I had in my mind was that once I'm dead, there won't be anyone to dream more about the dreams that I have, there won't be anyone who'll like to live the life I want to live. All my hopes and aspirations will cease to exist the moment I cease to exist.

And it's not about just dying in your sleep, any type of death has the same result: everything stops, nothing matters and the world around just keeps moving the way it has always moved. Some prayers will be held, some tears will be shed, and you'll be remembered but pretty soon <a title="The Fly" href="http://www.inlex.org/stories/mansfield/thefly.html" target="_blank">even that stops</a>.

Death is as real as life, and whatever life is made up of. All the thoughts we have are real (truism is another matter), so are the relationships we have, the air we breathe, the clothes we wear, everything is real, and so is death. Everything is probable in life: one can be rich, poor, smart, dumb, healthy, weak etc., but unlike death, none of them is 100% certain.

<blockquote>"Death is nothing to us, since when we are, death has not come, and when death has come, we are not." -- Epicurus.</blockquote>

But the fear of death, for most of us non-philosophers, is as certain as death. And it's funny since life is about making choices, good or bad, moral or evil (or neutral) but each one of them moves us closer to death; and then, nothing, silence; there isn't a choice about that one.

It's not me only, but anyone who dies in sleep won't miss anything. It's just like a long sleep, when the morning didn't come, a deep sleep without the morning light. So is the case in any other type of death: painful, painless, euthanasia induced death, the morning never comes. The best you can do after death is to roll in your grave.<sup>1</sup>

There's an excellent <a title="The 4 stories we tell ourselves about death" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/stephen_cave_the_4_stories_we_tell_ourselves_about_death" target="_blank">Ted talk</a> by Stephen Cave about four ways of tricking ourselves into believing that death is unreal and that somehow we can keep living in some other life. So why do we do all this running away from death? The fear of death is hard-wired into our brains and it's there in the head of anything that moves. Ironically, without it, there's no living. Without the fear of death, there's no difference between the rush of doing something deadly, like bungee jumping and actually jumping off a cliff. It's what saved us from predators across so many millennia. And then we developed consciousness, invented religion and money and lo: dying started to suck suddenly because we lose all that when we die. Fear of death is pretty bad mentally and emotionally, but I guess instead of treating death as something inevitable, people are brainwashed into believing that something good happens after death, and this is ironical again since people are supposed to be happy if something good is going to happen to them after death. Does that mean that people are aware that they're going to hang on a tandoor in hell because of all their evil deeds and so simply dont' want to die and do anything to save their asses?

<blockquote>"We are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed. Whatever years be behind us are in death's hands." Seneca in 1st letter to Lucilius</blockquote>

So now we have seen the inevitability of death and why we fear it, the question is what do we do about it? Well, apart from the fact that we can't really delay it and can't totally remove it from the brain wirings, the only reasonable way is to accept it. Ancient Greeks/Romans (and civilizations around that part) were pretty smart; and suicidal. They didn't believe in the concept of hiding behind gods and extending their lives. They waged wars and died, or committed suicide (Seneca, Cato) or embraced death (Cicero). We moderns aren't that manly (or stupid, give or take) but we can learn from them none the less.

Stoics believed that reminding yourself that you're going to die one day helps in reducing the fear of death.

				<title>What if it is?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0EcNdM79sA

The video posted above is what I found to be one of the best episodes of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0248654/">Six Feet Under</a> and one of the best conversations in the series. David, the guy on the left had been robbed, drugged, beaten up, made to lie with a dead body, almost immolated and had a gun put in his mouth a few episodes ago, which is rightly calls the "worst fucking experience" of his life. Nathaniel, his dead father, who visits the family members when they're confused, is proud of him because he got over his fear of coming face to face with his perpetrator.

"What if it is? What if life really is so simple, that I can take it as it comes, without trying to find any meaning?" This thought has echoed in my mind a lot of times after I heard it. I had the habit of finding meaning in everything, every relationship, every incident, every conversation and in the process, ironically, I almost always got lost while searching for this hidden meaning and intellectualizing the situation in general.

Since the last one year, I’ve had a different approach of handling situations which go out of my hand, and this also includes the life in general which seems to be almost never in my control: I don’t try to find meaning of the situation. Instead, I now try to take the life as it comes. To do that, I regularly ask myself, is the situation really that bad or am I simply making it so by thinking too much about it? Is it really that complex or am I making it more complicated by coming up with all the possible scenarios and outcomes? In simple words, is it me who’s trying to find a meaning in the situation, or unnecessarily adding meaning if it lacks one?

As it turns out, most of the time I’m freaking out and complicating the situation. And it’s not until much later that I realise this.

“Some things are in our control and others are not.” Epictetus started his <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html">Manual</a> with this statement. And I’ve found it to be one of the best food-for-thoughts I’ve had. This desire to control the things which are not under our control is what complicates the situation. And mostly it is the desire to control other people’s thought, the desire to have in my possession something which isn’t mine, or to have an alternate closure to a past situation. This desire is the starting point where the mind starts scheming how can I control other person's thoughts, or how can I get in the possession of something which I want so badly, or to have a right and happy ending to a situation which I screwed up? Once this scheme is finalised in the fantasy world, the mind next starts scheming about how the life is going to be much better when I finally have the person, the thing or life under my spell. And this is a vicious cycle, where every time I have the situation figured out, I have a deeper desire to control it and make it more glossy and perfect. In simple terms, it's me who's making a simple life complicated.

This sounds bad enough, and from conversations that I have with other people and with myself, it became clear that the desire to control something which is outside one's control is present in everyone. Everyone wants to be rich and famous, to be blessed with Fortuna and Pheme, and to control what is not in their control: life, death, other people's thoughts to name a few.

I’m no expert in decoding the meaning of life, and in the worst case scenario, I hope, there isn’t any meaning to life, to the suffering, the joy and everyday incidents which I don't even remember. I have found that life doesn’t have to be extraordinarily complex and confusing. It is what it is. While the father in the above video doesn’t want any phony existential bullshit, there is always a point sticking out: that there is no point. Not David's version about his helplessness but Nathaniel's version that there's no point in complicating the situation. You have a life, realise the temporary setback and move on.

Nowadays I mostly take the life as it comes, one step at a time, keeping most of the situations which confuse me and complicate the life, at bay. Not every situation has to be meaningful, not every situation has to be intellectual; there are some things which simply are, and the realization that I have no control over them is relaxing. And while giving everything I have to situations I can control is needed, the best decision in other situations is to move on because then the life becomes simple enough.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[[&#8230;] I think one way of having a balance between the rationality and reality is to find a difference between the needs and the wants, and once that is done, it&#8217;s all about sticking with the former most of the time. I say find because different people have different needs and one man&#8217;s need is another man&#8217;s want (and vice versa). While someone might want a superbike, he might need only a vehicle to get from one point to another. While someone might want a 1,600 m2 room house, what he might need is a trailer home. It&#8217;s finally comes down to simplifying the life. [&#8230;]]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tens of million years ago, a seed was planted on the face of the earth and over all the time that seed gave birth to what we are today: humans. It took so much time for humans to evolve from our fickle minded ape ancestors, but the evolution hasn't stopped and the human being still evolves over his lifetime.

Man is made to evolve, every aspect of his, mental, physical, spiritual is meant to change over time. The time works on a smaller scale, like decades when man changes the phases of his life, evolving from a child to a teenager, or from teenager to being an adult. All this time, his physical body goes through a metamorphosis, so does his mind. Millennia of evolution made man what he is today, decades of evolution makes a man what he is when he dies. And just like nature acted like a filter, selectively removing part which were not needed for evolution or survival, nature gave man a part of evolution, the mind to filter out ideas which he doesn't need. And by using this machinery, the human mind, one can transcend to a whole new level. What one becomes is the sum total of ideas one has collected over the course of life. Evolution didn't end when a human specimen was made by nature, or when human developed supreme intellect, it is still going on and will keep going on. The trick is to use it to our advantage.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Life is ruled by time. Though some people get more and some people get less time in their lives depending on how early they die, the reality is that everyone gets equal number of hours everyday and this number gets reset every 24 hours. In words of <a title="How to live on 24 hours a day" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2274/2274-h/2274-h.htm" target="_blank">Arnold Bennett</a>

<blockquote>We never shall have any more time. We have, and we have always had, all the time there is.</blockquote>

I got this idea that the time a person has can be divided amongst different time scales and what scale one uses as the primary scale defines the kind of life one has. Though I also guess this is like a chicken and egg problem, the kind of scale a person chooses depends a lot on that person, and vice versa.

<ul>
    <li><strong>Short Time Scale</strong>: The person using this scale thinks only a few minutes in the future, lives impulsively and looks for instant gratification in almost anything he does. Other people are stupid for him, gadgets too slow, a delay in flight sends him to a state of panic. He wants everything to be done instantly, thinking about life is boring, so is introspection. If he is alone, access to TV or facebook is paramount, girlfriend taking time to get ready is painful. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_God_Go" target="_blank">Eric Cartman</a> came to my mind, who transported himself to the future in order to get his hands on Wii. While this pattern is visible in me sometimes, there are others I know who make it visible on a regular basis. Such people move too fast for life because they are moving forward with the speed of thought which is infinite, while the life moves ahead a moment at a time. Years keep on flowing, and the realization that life largely has passed often comes too late.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li> <strong>Medium Time Scale</strong>: These people think in weeks at a time, they do have goals but also the realisation that most the of the things do not happen in instants and hence their goals are spread over time. Office going people might fall in this category since they know that a big project cannot finish in a week; there are far too many variables and loose points to consider and realise to go ahead with the implementation. People who have undertaken the task of learning something new, especially which is artistic (and not logical which our life is sadly filled with these days), like singing, instrument or drawing also understand (or soon realise) that fixing the foundation takes time and it's only after completing that one can move forward. A person living on a short time scale will throw away the instrument he's trying to learn because it's taking time, a person using this time scale at least gets his fundamentals ready.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Long Time Scale</strong>: This time scale spans decades and covers a lifetime and for people in this group, small setbacks do not matter. A person living in this time-scale realises that even though his favourite cup was broken by his maid, this is not going to affect his tomorrow; even though he was insulted in front of a group of people, this is not going to be remembered five years from now; a small financial disaster isn't going to kill him, there is enough time remaining to earn a bit more. Person living in this time scale usually comes to understand that there are only a few things which are necessary in life and everything else is <a title="Hedonic Treadmill" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill" target="_blank">superficial</a>, not adding to the quality and happiness of life. Life becomes his best friend, always present, teaching him the essentials and this friend is usually just a thought away. Person of this group knows that it takes more than a few years to make who he is, and he has the realisation that it will take his whole life to be what he wants to be -- the best version of himself.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Infinite Time Scale</strong>: Just realise that more than <a title="Number of dead people" href="http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2002/HowManyPeopleHaveEverLivedonEarth.aspx" target="_blank">90% of people who ever lived are dead</a>, and ever since humans became intelligent enough to <a title="Cradle of Civilization" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_of_civilization" target="_blank">start civilizations </a>only few million people (a figure I pulled out of thin air) have been famous, which means more than 99% of people left without making their mark. I might have taken <a title="Woody Allen on life" href="http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/woody-allen-0913" target="_blank">this</a> Woody Allen quote out of context, but he explains the infinite time scale so beautifully:
<blockquote>It's just an accident that we happen to be on earth, enjoying our silly little moments, distracting ourselves as often as possible so we don't have to really face up to the fact that, you know, we're just temporary people with a very short time in a universe that will eventually be completely gone. And everything that you value, whether it's Shakespeare, Beethoven, da Vinci, or whatever, will be gone. The earth will be gone. The sun will be gone. There'll be nothing.</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Often people don't live in this scale, and I guess they shouldn't on a regular basis, but realization that such scale exists and death is as much real as life gives a clearer outlook on life itself, for instance life stops being a race and becomes a journey. It helps to care about things which really matter and gives the confidence to do things which one would never have done before.</p>

I find it impossible to be always using only one scale. From what I know, the best returns in the investment of life come from sometimes using Infinite time scale; mostly using the Long and Medium scales and staying away from using the short time scale as much as possible.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>The Cost of Independence</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Every person likes the other person to be like him, it's unconscious. When somebody is telling me as to why his football team is better than other teams, he's essentially asking me to look at the way he sees one part of his life and agree with him that his point of view is right. If I tell him that his team is a big piece of shit, then I'll be struck with great vengeance and furious anger.

Give this theory a romantic angle, if someone who likes me is agreeing to come to me and do something she usually doesn't do, then she is trying to be like me, because I'd start liking a person more if she has something in common. This usually is involuntary, though one can reap the benefits if required.

And so on and so forth.

Every one person wants the other person to be like him, that doesn't really matter unless one person's thoughts start interfering and overriding other people's thoughts. Then we have a problem and the world is in danger, that is what happened in WW2, and that is what happens in today's time when a leader asks his followers to do something evil. But look around, even at a personal level, everyone will tell you what you have to do directly or indirectly.

That becomes the sole reason why you will shatter hearts when you try to be independent, thinking for yourself.

So let me digress and take an example of how the life of a typical person, who lives to be 80, is meshed and entangled with so many other people's lives. Dividing his time in years, I get:

0-10: Under the supervision of parents.

10-20: Teenage. Hates parents due to hormones, under the supervision of friends.

20-30: Parents are OKayish. Colleagues, friends still matter a lot.

30-40: Spouse is the king/queen. Parents are good. Kids drive them nuts.

40-50: Another decades with teenage kids (which are stupid and self-centered) and spouse. Parents and community club people are lost-friends-who-came-back-in-life.

50-60: Parents are possibly dead, kids have moved out. Friends are those who share the same political, national and cultural beliefs.

60-70: You had too much sugar and a sedentary lifestyle and probably died of cancer. If not then your kids and spouse love you (trust me, it is possible) and you still have those old-farts from your community.

70-80: Some bad years in bed and you die.

Observe how social a normal person is. In almost every decade he'll have a circle of other people whom he trusts/loves/admires and a great chunk of his life depends on them.

Let’s get back to the discussion. Think about an occasion when a person you were really fond of didn't have the same way of thinking about an important-to-you idea. Ouch, you felt a pang of awkwardness and started putting your point across more clearly. Finally a debate ensued, and none of the parties won. The feeling after that debate is what I call “breaking of the heart”. But that’s completely normal, that's how we sell ourselves and that's how we roll.

If you try to be independent, you will break a few hearts every decades. You will have to say no to those people whom you really like and they like you back. You will have to look at their sad, stupid faces because that one time their thoughts and your thoughts won't have the same wavelength and none of you is going to accept the ideas. And that is when you'll feel you’ve done the inevitable. You have broken the hearts, said no to the ideas which are important to your parents, your friends, your SO, your colleagues. Because let’s face it, the moment you'll have sense of what kind of people you're sitting with, you'll have a thought crossing your mind that maybe you are not like these people, maybe you don't really flow with their ideas. Be it your religious beliefs, your cultural beliefs, your political beliefs, if you've thought about it yourself, with neutral mind, there are chances that you'll find differences from the people you've been hanging out with. And then someday you decide to break the chord and make them furious. But all the while before that, you had some very weird feelings, feeling of being ostracised, the feeling that you'll be all alone in this world if you don't tag along with these people, but that's just one of the irrational fears from the times society was just you and 50 other people. The truth is, there will always be like-minded people who'll welcome you with open arms and who try to dictate your life a lot less that "those" people.

Life is an experiment, you only live once, it's okay to make mistakes and break hearts, people who really love you will stick around no matter what. But if these mistakes aren't made because you want to make someone else happy instead of living your life, then your life becomes one big mistake and then you have to bear the consequences every few years.

Either treat life as an experiment, or live it like a mistake. Either be independent, or be a foot mat for other people. The cost of independence is breaking hearts, and it needs to be paid in full.

				<title>Rationality and Reality</title>
		<link>http://tushartyagi.com/rationality-and-reality/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The thoughts that we have can be divided into two schools. I have what I'd call real thoughts and rational thoughts. Both of them are obviously real, but rationality has more touch to life and has its practicality: it contains the thoughts which directly affect the life I'm living. Reality on the other hand has thoughts which are always present behind the scenes, such thoughts are naked, hide nothing and while they continue to exist they don't really come into view frequently.

In order to define the difference, let me take a clichéd example, one where a person finds that he has terminal illness and will die in few months. The difference that comes to the mind when we think about the way he lives his life before and after finding about the illness is the difference between what I call the rational and real thoughts. Usually, severing his connections with his job is the first thing that person does (maybe punch his boss on his way out, kiss the lovely secretary etc..), then he comes to realise that what an asshole he has been all these years: running after money and fame and not doing what he loved all his life, he tries now to devote time to his family, love his kids more, maybe pick up a hobby that he left many years ago; his career, something that was the most important part of his life, now takes a back seat. We have seen and heard about this happening to a lot of people, people who had their priorities changed after finding out that they have a limited time here.

Wasn't such a person's loved ones there before he got sick? Weren't his interests present in his heart before he came to realise about his mortality? They were and they were. But before coming in terms with life, before coming to realise that life is sometimes as fragile as the house of cards, he was thinking in rational terms. And now coming face to face with reality of life, he's in a totally different ballgame.

It would appear that I suggest it's wrong to be rational; it's absolutely not. The idea is to be rational all the while being in touch with the reality of life as well. The reality of life isn't about mortality, it isn't only about the fact that most of the people will and do die without making mark in the sands of time, it's about living life all the while being in touch with these facts.

Rationality is needed. It's the rational thoughts that we have about so many things that give us the money to buy food and clothes for our bodies, a house to live in and to live an overall comfortable life. But till what limit does one has to go for this comfort, till when should a person run after things he doesn't require? For this calculation, one needs to be thinking in terms of reality. Where will the money go once he's dead? It's of no use to him then. But before he dies, he requires, with all his heart, the love of his family and friends, and in this situation he's asking for some more time to be added to his life.

I think one way of having a balance between the rationality and reality is to find a difference between the needs and the wants, and once that is done, it's all about sticking with the former most of the time. I say find because different people have different needs and one man's need is another man's want (and vice versa). While someone might want a superbike, he might need only a vehicle to get from one point to another. While <a title="Tom Shadyac" href="%20http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Shadyac" target="_blank">someone </a>might want a 1,600 m<sup>2</sup> room house, what he might need is a trailer home. It's finally comes down to <a title="What if it is?" href="http://tushartyagi.com/what-if-it-is/" target="_blank">simplifying the life</a>.

And once a person starts simplifying life, not only does he have more time to go after things which really matter on <a title="Time Scales of Life" href="http://tushartyagi.com/time-scales-of-life/" target="_blank">the time scale of life</a>, he also has the boon of being away from things which come at the cost of what matters most.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If I take a seat while waiting for someone, the first reaction is to pull the phone out of my pocket and start doing something on it; starting usually with checking the time. I look around and see other people doing that too; almost everyone who is alone is either listening to the music, looking into their phone screens; even if there is a group of people, chances are that they are doing something on their phone. It won't be wrong to say that a lot of people are just zoning themselves out by looking at the life of fantasy, past, future or someone else (Facebook, twitter) and then thinking about how good or bad it is?

The human brain has been designed to think continuously, we had been thinking and working our way out of obstacles, difficult and life-threatening situations ever since we were animals living in the forests. Then came the time when we had to think in order to hunt, kill, eat, make fire, discover new ideas, invent new things, and as a result we are living in a world full of comforts where almost everything can now be done at a click of a button, this is magical going by the standards of people living only 100 years ago.

Evolutionarily, all this thinking provided our brain with an auto-pilot mode for a lot of situations; this is good and required so I don't have to think too much when filling a glass of water and drinking from it, or taking a car out for a ride. But the problem with zoning out is that in a lot of situations I just do things without thinking about them at all, as if I was high.

For instance, when I'm playing an interesting video game, or reading an interesting book, the answer to every question that I'm asked becomes "Yes", and this causes a few surprises for me sometimes. The answer to both "Do you want to eat, I'm preparing something?" and "I'm going out, I won't cook today." becomes "OK", which is problematic in situations when the food is ready and I am already full, or when there's no food prepared and I'm famished. Another instance is when I just sit on a chair and keep thinking about the future or the past.

Mindfulness, by its virtue, is about living life in the present, wherein one's mind is full with whatever is going around him. It is about being more physically present in the moment, than being mentally present. So when you walk you can feel the ground, hear the tap of your shoes, feel the gusts of wind on your face, feel the cloth on your body. The time becomes a lot more slow, since you have so much to feel or observe in every instance. It becomes a walking meditation, bringing inner peace and calm, where the worries about the future and mistakes of the past find no place. The person becomes an observer of whatever is going around him; he passes no judgements, or thinks how he would do it differently, because doing that takes him away from the present moment.

But living in the present is pretty difficult, since we are made to think, to think about the past in order to learn from our mistakes, or to think about the future in order to make plans and do things.

In the past, that made a lot of sense. When fire was discovered, controlling it would have killed a lot of our ancestors. One of our ancestors was killed because he was curious the way bushes were moving that way and then was promptly killed by sabre toothed tiger. So learning from the past served us to survive over the millenia.

Thinking about the future made us more open to new ideas, I imagine the early humans saw that a few of their mates were killed after falling over large and sharp stones, and they imagined what it would be like to throw them at the enemies. Newton was possibly thinking about the future when apple fell over his head (or in front of him, whatever the case).

But that much thinking isn't really needed for every hour of every day, the life expectancy of humans have increased from a 30 to around 65, we are no longer surrounded by so many threats and while the technology is moving at an exponential rate, it's not going to help us to think about the future too much at an individual level.

I've found that I have a habit of zoning out every now and then, daydreaming about situations and while studies prove that it is good for the brain and sparks creativity, and if I take a bus I know that I'm not the only one doing that (one quick check is to see if the other person is looking through you, into the infinite), and some of the ideas that I have come from daydreaming and letting my mind go off the way, but that isn't something that I want to do for a majority of time, after all dreaming always feels better than doing.

Thinking too much about the past might depress us, and thinking too much about the future might make us anxious, and that's why mindfulness becomes important because it forces one to live in the present. The word forces is important since this mode of living is difficult to be in because of evolutionary wiring and because the whole idea of present is so difficult to grasp because of it's transitive nature. It only comes a moment at a time, unlike the past and the future which have a more "block" like structure and are more easier to think about or imagine. Unlike the past and the future, the present quickly becomes long, boring or difficult.

The advantages of mindfulness are though, multiple:
Improved concentration
Reduced anxiety
Reduced depression
Too many chances of getting into the flow
Good ideas might come up more frequently

The way I try to be more mindful is:
Starting small, trying to be mindful in the tasks which only takes a few seconds at a time, but occur very frequently or everyday like eating, drinking, walking to the kitchen, toilet, in my room etc.
Meditation
Exercise
Mindful walks few times a week
Be more mindful, whenever the thought of being mindful comes up. It's a cycle, be more mindful and the mind comes up with the idea of being mindful.

The brain can be taught to do so many things, and I've noticed that once I start being mindful more often throughout the day, the idea of being more mindful keeps on coming up again and again]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I keep going back to some texts which are magical and give a great perspective to life, the the life really happens and the magical effect wears off, that's why I keep going back to them. David Foster Wallace's speech "This is water" is one of such magical texts. I read it again a few days ago to relearn that life really isn't about what I think it is about, it's not only about me, it's not only about other, it's for all of us, knowingly or otherwise my actions do affect other people. I don't really give a damn about that thing, but there's another takewaway from this text, it's that we constantly need to be aware of the way we are living the life, spending the time or we'll 1) simply miss out on lot of opputunities and incidents which keep on happening all around us, 2) instead of taking a life as it is, we are going to get an incorrect perception of it.

So in TIW, DFW serves the fact that the life of an average adult is really boring most of the time. I can vouch for that, since on busy days outside of office hours, the life simply goes by, I come home, cook, read something, sleep, wake up, exercise a bit and go back to office. Just this superficial desciption of life sounds boring. Time is slow when it's passing but then you look back and realise that it went quite fast.

Unless one is financially independent, Almost everyday of an adult's life is boring, long, slow, until it ends and you wake up for another day, when the previous day seems so small because you had been on the auto mode all the previous day with only a handful of incidents to remember, only a few conversations worth liking and and this goes on for weeks, months, and years until the person realises that he doesn't remember almost all the year that flew by. The best guess I can make is that we have only a few hundred hours or so of memories out of an entire year. (It's a different thing that we remember a lot of things that happen to us, especially ones which are different but those are affected by our present emotions/situations, but I'm talking about magical memories. Read Stumbling On Happiness for more details on how we store the memories).

The way I see it, there are two ways of remembering the life. The first one is to have a journal of some sort, record all the great and bad things that happen to you, it doesn't have to be filled everyday but the more the better, it also gives the practice of clearning the thoughts and adding new thoughts and ideas to whatever you're writing about.

The second thing and which DFW suggests so beautifully is to be more mindful. First thing: Mindfulness is hard and one cannot be mindful all the time, it's mentally taxing and uses the willpower (of which we have limited amount). But when one starts to be more mindful, the returns are exponential. just being mindful for a few more minutes in a day will not only build the endurance of being more mindful over time, but also increase the mindful life by a few days.

Like I wrote before, being mindful makes the life slow, one has more time to enjoy every moment that passes and gets the option to live life at an leisurely pace. When life is slow, like in the line at the supermarket, it just might add a few minutes to the life, if one has the attention of being more mindful. Instead of attending to the fat lady and her crying kid, think about what good happened today and what all things were you thankful for.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>The Social Animal, Not!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ahhh, Man the social animal. I sometimes wonder what would have happened if we were not social like we are, but were un-social, individual reptiles like snake. We’d been either wiped out off the face of the planet or would have remained totally unevolved, to the point that I would not have been sitting here writing about my fellow men.

While this social connection has led us to where we are today, and we absolutely love being social, in company of other beings, it has also hardwired our brain to feel uncomfortable, uneasy and sometimes jealous of a person who doesn’t behave in the way social rules work. Add the fact that internet has made the world so small from what it used to be, we are constantly in touch with such individuals. And what do we do? We hate them for being too individualistic.

We love drama, we love to see other people suffer, we love pointing out other person’s mistakes and we don’t like, most of the time, when the other person succeeds. We totally ignore the fact that almost every one of us has the ability to do what the other person has done but probably we are too smart for that, we are too smart to indulge in practicing the tools of our trade, most of us are too smart to try something new, too smart to break our social barrier and move out of our comfort zone, too damn ignorant to tell other person, who is doing one thing better than us, that he isn’t doing some other thing right; we are too busy asking fishes to climb trees<sup><a title="Everybody is a Genius. But If You Judge a Fish by Its Ability to Climb a Tree, It Will Live Its Whole Life Believing that It is Stupid." href="http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/04/06/fish-climb/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>.

And yet, time after time we come across people who make some change in the world, through their sheer persistence and hard work, we come across people who leave the comforts of the world to take up the challenges which the world throw at their faces and instead of taking inspiration from these people we like to blame them for not doing enough in some other field. We fail to recognize that they are making the world a little bit better but focus on the fact that what they are doing is too little to change the world in any comparable manner.

Our cousins apes don’t have such complex system for living, they have a group of around 150 and they are intelligent enough to break it into subgroups if the number becomes too large. They somehow know, instinctively, that too many cooks will spoil the broth, which is something we people fail to learn from our primitive brethren. We like to be connected to almost no one socially and thousands of people virtually, and then act as if the social environment is the place to be, like we are designed to not breath air but the bits and bytes of social network, and when people are not connected socially in any way, they become more stupid and generally ignorant of people around them.

Human face is a treasure trove of emotions, the cheeks, the forehead, the eyes show the emotions as they really are. Tell someone you love her and she’ll look into your eyes the moments she can move past the overwhelming emotion your words elicit, meet someone you love and you can see the twinkle in her eyes, the unfakable smile tells you how genuinely interested a person is in you, all of this is absent from the virtual media which has suddenly become the preferred way people connect. And since the other person isn’t looking at your face, shouting, bitching, and being vitriolic becomes a lot easier. You can’t or won’t tell a person on her face that she’s ugly, but commenting that over her latest photo is easy because you won’t be there to see the look on her face.

I have come across people who have realized that the social media is something less-than-complimentary to one’s real life, and these people are always very interesting and entertaining. And then there are others who just live to update their pages with the latest and the greatest things that are happening to them, manufacturing their profiles one picture at a time. (There are some people hanging in the middle, tilting themselves in either group, but they are out of the scope of this article).

While this article has been good enough to show my disliking towards the social media, I still would like to give a TL;DR treatment which is that we are social animals, we absolutely love other people and looking at their frozen faces through a computer screen tend to fuck us up. Given a choice (and one always has this choice), one should prefer social life over social media. Will someone play with me?!

				<title>The First Rehearsal of Life - Part 1</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Almost every religion teaches about a life after death. A person will either live in some sort of paradise, living a life amidst unlimited food, milk, music and virgins, or will go through excruciating pain in hell; in some books he will be born again as a human, a monkey, a mosquito or as some other form of life. Since I am an atheist, all these ideas sound a bit crazy to me. I like to believe that we just die, nothing else happens afterwards and wagering on the fact that there’s a life after death takes away or hinders the pleasures that are available in the life right now.

Is this life always full of pleasures? No, it isn’t. But has there ever been a proof that it will be so after I die? I’ve never met a ghost in my life, who can explain that there is life after death. Nor have I been reached out by some angel giving me the details of the next big plan. So l like to live life thinking that there won’t be another one after I die.

The idea for what I’m writing now came after I started reading “The Unbearable Lightness of Being” which had the following sentence somewhere in the beginning:

<blockquote>What can life be worth if the first rehearsal for life is life itself?</blockquote>

I have not finished that book so I don’t know the answer of this question as described in the book, but I’ll try to answer that question using the ideas and thoughts that I’ve come across living the life. Maybe I’ll write another updated post after I’ve finished that book but as of now I’ll just go ahead without filling any blanks. FYI: It’s an interesting read.

So, coming back, different people have different answers to that question. There are some, which live in the future, waiting for the next life since this one is filled with bad people, screwed up opportunities and a totally wrong/indecent way of living. For those people, this life isn’t worth living, it’s just a painful journey which they have to bear in order to get closer to their real, eternal life, which ironically starts after they die. Ironically too, for all the love they have for the next life, such people won’t take their lives in order to reach the final destination a wee bit early, they are waiting for some divine intervention in order to reach the eternal place of belonging.

The idea of eternal life is amazing. Sometimes I want to live eternally, not to meet some sort of creator, but to see where the world is going and how it will be a few hundred years from now. How the galaxy is going to be a few million years from now and how the universe is going to be a few trillion years from now. While I like living in fantasy, I also like to keep a foot in the present moment and that reminds me what I’m thinking isn’t going to happen and it is better to live the life as it is presented to me, a moment at a time. And since I don’t believe in reincarnation, the life that I am living right now becomes the first rehearsal and final take of life.

This realization was unsettling when I first thought about it, because I wasn’t always non-religious. I had the mental conditioning of believing that there will be a reincarnation and if I did good deeds, I’ll born a human again. And suddenly when that comforting thought was removed from my grip, life indeed became a bit difficult and confusing because the principle of my life for so many years was that there’s another life after death. What shall I do if I will just die someday with nothing following afterwards; why had I been taught that there is life after death? Those and other thoughts plagued my mind.

Time passed after I had those thoughts and then, after a long journey where I read so many books and came across different ideas, I logically deduced that it’s much better to be a better human being in this life than to wait for another one after this ends. The life that I am living right now, is full of beautiful segments which are divided across so many years with every segment presenting something new and challenging to me. I’ve only completed two decades -- I remember nothing of the first one and the second one was filled with emotional highs -- but those two have prepared me to look forward to the gentle unfolding of the pattern of life.

Then again the question comes which Milan Kunder asked in his book: <strong>What can life be worth if the first rehearsal for life is life itself? </strong>The answer that I have is what the life has taught me in the last few years: it goes on. It’s not something for which you have to rehearse in order to live, when living my life, I have to be like an actor of improv theater, who starts with no story whatsoever and as the hero, have to make the story, find the answers, make decisions and deal with the consequences as they come. And the more I’ll accept the situations, the better the play will become. There’s no point fighting against every situation and every person, some of them are good and can help me.

I also realized that I cannot have any control over a lot of situations that life throws at me. I can have control over the thoughts that I have and the actions that I take when faced with challenges, but anything beyond that is out of my control and I am too insignificant to make any damage. I cannot rehearse, I don’t have the option of doing that, the only option that I have is to just go with the flow, keeping an eye on situations and acting on those which I can affect.

				<title>Books are alive</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Imagine a friend that talks to you whenever you want her to, and listens to you, and tells you stories, takes you away from the hustle bustle of daily life. Sometimes you are close to her and close you are to your thoughts, and you realise that you understand her in a unique and personal way. There are other people with whom this friend meets or has met, and through her, you also come across new people, share your ideas, maybe make a few new connections.

We can easily replace the friend with a book. Here I'm not talking about some science tome, those are dead books, and just like thoroughly logical person, those aren't liked by a lot of people, I am talking about books which carry with them stories, amazing ones which force you to lose yourself into the characters' lives, to travel to their world, and to exotic locations with them; books which introduce some of the most fascinating characters you've come across, or the most witty, whose dialogues make you smile or laugh out loud, forget all your pains and worries; or sometimes to characters which repulse you, or make you cringe by their dialogues, decisions or way of life.

Just like real world, a book has in itself another world, an alien one, which is just filled with characters, human or otherwise and everything is just at an arms length, or less. You move to different places, to exotic locations, from the forests of amazon to the snow laden peaks of arctic to the deserts of Sahara and the prairies of north Africa, or sometimes to another planet, or galaxy altogether where you meet alien life, or our own robust human brethren who have settled there a few millennia before. With that you move around in time, or meet people who do move around in time. You realise how one world is destroyed and also how one was created a few thousand years ago.
